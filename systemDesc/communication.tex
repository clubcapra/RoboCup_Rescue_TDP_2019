Report about your wifi hardware in detail. Tell us the vendor and model of your hardware - access point and antennas. Describe which protocol your hardware is working with. Let us know what is the maximum power your hardware supports and what is the power-setting you will be using during the competition.  Tell us the gain of your antennas. Tell us the SSID you will be using (typically it should be "RRL\_teamname").
