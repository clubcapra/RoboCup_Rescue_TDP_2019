\subsection{Hardware}
Document the hardware of your system. This can be very brief if you bought the robot (in this case mention the major modifications). The first image of this document (should also appear on the first page) should be a photo of your real robot - see Figure \ref{fig:robotPhoto}.

Refer to the Tables \ref{tab:SystemRobot1} and following as well as Table \ref{tab:HardwareList} in the Appendix - there is no need to document part here in detail if it is sufficient to know that it is used from the tables. Please also share your CAD drawings or electronics plans with the community! Do so by adding a big picture to the appending AND by providing the files in a commonly used format as ancillary files \url{http://arxiv.org/help/ancillary_files}.

Explain your approach regarding those topics - create relevant subsubsections as needed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Locomotion
  \item Power (Batteries)
  \item Electronics, including micro-controllers, etc.
  \item Manipulation/ directed perception
  \item Sensors
  \item Computation (high performance for autonomy, etc.)
  \item Communication is covered in its own subsection - mention the regarding hardware and software there.
  \item Others...
\end{itemize}
